# Morrow Mail feature coverage

Morrow is an independent implementation, not a complete GenMail clone. The reference features below come from Genspark's public product-video descriptions and chapter metadata. They verify advertised capabilities, not hands-on product behavior. No claim of exhaustive parity is made.

The app's authoritative behavior list is [`shared/features.js`](shared/features.js): **19 behaviors**, comprising **8 model-backed actions** and **11 local simulations**. Every behavior has a server-enforced permission checkbox.

## Status definitions

- **Implemented, manual:** runs against the configured model when requested. Demo mode has labeled illustrative output without a model. Generated text remains reviewable.
- **Mock simulation:** deterministic local preview followed by an explicit apply action where relevant. Never invokes the model, sends mail, accesses the web/calendar, or fetches attachments.
- **GenMail verified:** explicitly advertised in the July 2026 GenMail launch or product demonstration.
- **Predecessor/broader Genspark:** advertised for earlier AI Inbox or Super Agent; current GenMail equivalence is unconfirmed.
- **Inferred addition:** useful coverage supplied by this project, not directly verified as a GenMail feature.

## AI behavior coverage

| Behavior / catalog ID | Reference evidence | Morrow implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email summaries — `summary` | Predecessor/broader Genspark: Outlook summarization [5] | **Implemented.** Manual summaries plus opt-in on-open and newly synced mail triggers; persisted arrival reports validate P0–P4 classification. |
| Suggested replies — `reply` | GenMail verified: personalized replies [1] | **Implemented.** Manual or opt-in on-reply suggestions using the configured tone and permitted context; review before insertion or sending. |
| Ask your inbox — `ask` | Inferred addition; precise GenMail question-answer/search behavior unconfirmed | **Implemented, manual.** Searches permitted cached mail and asks the model using a bounded set of messages. |
| Write new emails — `write` | GenMail advertises email drafting [1]; this standalone prompt-to-draft mode is inferred | **Implemented, manual.** Turns user instructions into draft text. |
| Rewrite drafts — `rewrite` | Inferred addition | **Implemented, manual.** Rewrites supplied draft text under the draft/body permissions. |
| Translate — `translate` | Inferred addition | **Implemented, manual.** Translates permitted email or draft text into the chosen language. |
| Inbox briefing — `briefing` | GenMail morning briefing verified [1]; exact scheduling rules inferred | **Implemented.** On-demand digest or opt-in daily/time-zone and 1–168-hour schedules while the service runs. Automatic reports validate P0–P4 entries for a bounded cached context; no OS notifications. |
| Prioritize important mail — `triage` | GenMail verified [1] | **Mock simulation.** Reviews local priority candidates and can star them locally. |
| Smart labels — `labels` | Inferred addition | **Mock simulation.** Previews labels and applies them inside Morrow only. |
| Email Brain — `memory` | GenMail verified: learned writing/contact context [1] | **Studio simulation.** Creates inspectable local style/contact notes. Separately, Settings → Learning performs real opt-in model analysis of Sent samples, with budgeted previews, manual approval and optional weekly incremental proposals. No model-weight training or automatic profile application. Saved notes can inform model output only while the corresponding permission allows it. |
| People/company research — `research` | GenMail verified [1] | **Mock simulation.** Brief based on permitted email context; unknown facts remain unknown. No web lookup. |
| Meeting preparation — `meeting` | GenMail verified [1] | **Mock simulation.** Agenda and talking points from a selected email. No calendar retrieval. |
| Custom email skills — `skill` | GenMail verified [1], [2] | **Implemented, manual.** Create, edit, remove, and run saved instructions against permitted mail. Skills do not execute arbitrary tools. |
| Follow-up reminders — `followup` | Earlier AI Inbox advertises task tracking [3]; this reminder workflow is inferred | **Mock simulation.** Saves a local follow-up record; no notification scheduler or automatic follow-up mail. |
| Meeting scheduling — `schedule` | Predecessor/broader Genspark: calendar coordination [4], [5] | **Mock simulation.** Creates a local proposed event; no availability lookup, calendar booking, or invitation. |
| Inbox cleanup — `cleanup` | Inferred addition | **Mock simulation.** Previews newsletter archiving and applies it only to Morrow's cached inbox. |
| Unsubscribe assistant — `unsubscribe` | Inferred addition | **Mock simulation.** Records a simulated unsubscribe locally; does not visit links or contact mailing lists. |
| Attachment discovery/comparison — `attachments` | Earlier AI Inbox verified [3] | **Mock simulation.** Uses clearly marked sample attachment fixtures. Real attachments are neither fetched nor analyzed. |
| Batch personalized replies — `batchReplies` | Predecessor/broader Genspark verified [4] | **Mock simulation.** Previews and saves separate local draft replies. Never sends a batch. |

## Mail, settings, and platform coverage

| Area | Reference / implementation status |
| --- | --- |
| Agent CLI | **Included from 0.6.0-beta.3.** Existing Rust binary provides JSON accounts/list/search/read/draft/review/send; attaches to the running app or exclusively opens its workspace while closed. Cached reads do not mark read or trigger AI. Explicit account and send confirmation, generation/content-bound review, To/Cc/Bcc and uncertain request retention. No attachments, account setup, implicit sync or automatic resend. [Usage](docs/CLI.md). |
| Indexed mail search | **Implemented in current source.** Shared SQLite FTS5 index, one/two-character Chinese and traditional/simplified normalization, safe highlights/snippets, advanced operators/filters, folder/account/all-account scopes, account badges and cached coverage, relevance/date sorting, 30-result pagination, recent/saved searches and removable filters in both clients. Downloaded mail only; no attachments, arbitrary English infix/fuzzy matching or full inbox virtualization. |
| Smart search / semantic indexing | **Implemented, opt-in in current source.** Separate embedding URL/model/key, OpenAI-compatible or native Ollama, reviewed incremental batches, account/folder/content/date checkboxes intersected with AI permissions, estimated token budget and cancellation. Local hybrid ranking of up to 200 keyword + 200 semantic candidates; exact vector scan capped at 12,000 scoped chunks. Changed scope/model/connection invalidates vectors/results. New mail needs another reviewed batch; no automatic paid indexing. Actual embedding relevance and live-model acceptance remain unverified. |
| In-app desktop updates | **Implemented from 0.5.0-beta.2.** Explicit download, pinned Ed25519/SHA-256 verification, safe extraction, installation and automatic restart; keeps the previous app and guards edits/writes. Requires a writable installation parent. Browser development and older packages use manual download. Later startup crashes or interrupted installs can require manual backup recovery. |
| Gmail and Outlook | GenMail advertises both [1]. Morrow implements browser sign-in buttons with PKCE/state/browser-bound callbacks, paged 1/3/6/12-month Inbox/Sent import (legacy connections keep latest-50 Inbox sync until configured), and explicit manual sending. Native refresh follows the mailbox selected by a completed OAuth callback. Callback URLs are advanced registration details, not login links. Builds can include a publisher Google Desktop client for sign-in without entering credentials; advanced custom Google registration and Microsoft client-ID setup remain available. Google Cloud test-user/verification restrictions still apply; no authenticated provider testing is claimed. |
| IMAP/SMTP | Additional Morrow functionality requested for this project. TLS IMAP import and explicit SMTP sending are implemented; providers must support the configured authentication method. |
| Google and Microsoft calendars | **Implemented, manual.** Both can connect concurrently through separate calendar OAuth grants, independently of the current mail/demo account. Google supports the same built-in Desktop client or an advanced custom registration; Microsoft requires a client ID. Select a calendar, read events across a range of up to 90 days, and review before explicitly creating an event without attendees. These calls use the real provider APIs when connected; no authenticated calendar testing is claimed. |
| Multiple mail accounts | **Implemented.** Multiple Gmail, Outlook, and IMAP connections, independently collapsible account groups with remembered state, separate and combined folders, account-owned drafts/replies, a From picker for new messages, and per-account disconnect. Demo remains separate. |
| Mail organization | Search, drafts, read/unread, stars, archive, and trash are implemented locally. These shortcuts remain local. A separate reviewed Move / Labels dialog supports Gmail label add/remove and Inbox moves, Outlook folder moves, and IMAP MOVE + UIDPLUS folder moves within the owning account; full folder sync is not implemented. |
| Inbox views and composition | Compact / Comfortable / Spacious density; six persisted sort orders; To, Cc, Bcc and multiple recipients (100 total). Native macOS commands, standard window controls, saved window size and presets. |
| Custom model | User-supplied OpenAI-compatible base URL, model ID, optional API key, token limit, and temperature. Connection test uses a fixed prompt with no mail and does not save. |
| AI controls | Master switch, all 19 behavior switches, folder/content scopes, and maximum context count are enforced server-side for model calls and simulations. Disabled or out-of-scope actions are rejected. |
| Historical import & style learning | Native and Windows/browser settings offer date/folder choices, checkpointed pause/resume, up to 50 body-only samples intersected with global permissions, preflight sample/token estimates, editable reviewed style and optional weekly proposals. No AI on initial download, no hidden contact learning, no fine-tuning. Provider acceptance and huge-cache UI performance remain unverified. |
| AI triggers | Four default-off triggers: opening a message, starting an empty reply, newly synced mail, and daily/interval summaries. Inbox-only and starred-only filters intersect with server permissions. Both clients share persistent per-account jobs; no automatic sending or memory changes. Initial imports do not trigger arrival summaries; this is polling, not provider push. Failed/interrupted calls require manual action. |
| Update checks | Settings → About checks public GitHub releases, optionally including alpha/beta versions, and links to release downloads. Semantic version comparison, timeout, rate-limit/error states and one-minute caching; no automatic installation. |
| Email footer | Plain text or sanitized HTML, native/web previews, immutable draft snapshots, and multipart HTML/plain delivery through Gmail, Outlook and SMTP. One global signature; no images or full HTML message editor. |
| General settings | Display name, signature format/content, theme, density, mark-read behavior, tone, preferred AI response language, independent target translation language, and app-open sync interval (1/5/15/30 minutes or manual). Settings are global; workspace records remain account-specific. |
| Local operation | Production build served on loopback, health endpoint, graceful shutdown, and a verified database/key backup command. Public hosting, shared-user access, and production certification are not supplied by these controls. |
| Native applications | GenMail advertises Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android support [1]. Morrow provides a **native SwiftUI macOS app** and a responsive local web interface. Windows has a React / Electron desktop package sharing the same backend and version. iOS and Android apps are not implemented. |
| External automation | Autonomous calendar access, web research, provider unsubscribe, attachment processing, automatic application of memory/style updates, and automatic sending are **not implemented**. Relevant Studio workflows are labeled simulations. The separate Calendar page provides live **manual** reading and event creation only. |

Policy changes and disconnecting the owning account invalidate pending workflow previews. Switching views keeps previews bound to their original mailbox; a different account cannot apply them. Applying a preview rechecks permissions; the same plan cannot be applied twice. AI Calendar/contact/attachment scope checkboxes do not grant live access to an external service. Calendar-page connections are separate from the AI policy and persist across mail/demo switches. No connected calendar events enter AI context, and Studio scheduling never creates a live event.

Automated tests exercise local behavior and mocked provider responses. They are not evidence that a user's live mailbox, calendar, provider registration, or model endpoint is configured successfully. Remaining deployment prerequisites include real-account consent and acceptance checks; public or multi-user deployment additionally needs a defined hosting/authentication design and is currently unsupported.

## Native macOS surface

`macos/Sources/MorrowMail` implements the complete interface in SwiftUI: mail folders/search/reader, reviewed compose/send, custom model settings and connection testing, all AI behavior/scope switches, the 19-tool Studio, editable Brain and skills, local activity, and Google/Outlook calendar connections and agenda/event creation. It consumes the same feature catalog and policy-enforcing backend; mock/live distinctions in this document apply equally to native and web clients. The runtime is bundled in the generated `.app`. OAuth alone opens the user's browser.

Native acceptance checks: `npm run macos:test` validates JSON schema handling, unconfirmed-mail request identity, date/path handling, and persisted calendar retries, compiles SwiftUI, and exercises the actual native API client against private provider fixtures for all 19 behaviors, both calendars, send recovery, multi-account migration/routing, and combined views. `npm test` covers private native-service authentication/shutdown alongside provider, permission, workflow, send-recovery, and backup behavior. See README for signing, notarization, platform and live-account validation requirements.

## Paired desktop releases

From 0.4.0-alpha.1, macOS arm64 and Windows x64 are built from one tag and published together only after platform checks pass. Windows uses the existing React interface in a sandboxed Electron window; macOS remains SwiftUI. Account isolation, drafts, HTML footers, AI policies and manual provider operations share one backend. Window controls and layouts are platform-specific; identical visual design is not claimed. Windows includes Ctrl-based compose/search/sync/reply/save/review shortcuts and persistent sidebar/calendar recovery state. Both builds are experimental and lack stable distribution signing; real-account acceptance remains outstanding.

## Rust desktop service — 0.6.0-beta.1

- Both clients use 50-row mail metadata pages (maximum 100), all six sorts, SQL counts, on-demand full message/draft loading, signed revision-bound cursors, and stale-response guards. Sender/subject ordering accepts the client’s BCP 47 locale; native and differential fixtures cover numeric, accented and Chinese names.
- The complete Rust service implements the existing account, settings, draft/send, provider organization, OAuth, calendar, AI, workflow, learning, import, summary, search and updater contracts. Ownership, To/Cc/Bcc and uncertain-send review remain enforced at the service boundary.
- Node and Rust retain compatible encrypted settings, message identities and recovery files. First takeover creates a verified backup; OS workspace locking plus SQLite exclusive ownership prevents legacy writers. The Rust CLI provides verified backups without Node.
- Rust is the default desktop service from 0.6.0-beta.1, following explicit prerelease cutover approval. SwiftUI stays native; Windows keeps React/Electron. Both platforms must pass the tagged release gates before publication; Rust never falls back to Node.
- Isolated TLS provider/model tests and the actual native Rust client harness exercise the Rust service. See [verification](VERIFICATION.md) for current platform results, live-account/signing limits and benchmarks. Windows Tauri is deferred until the plan’s M5 stability gate.
