A more compact mail reader, in-place AI assistance and optional sender-history replies. Both packages are built from this same Git tag and pass the paired checks before publication.

What changed since 0.6.0-beta.8:
- Summarize, Suggest Reply and Translate open a message-bound popup without leaving your email for AI Studio. Review the result, then explicitly use a reply in an owned draft; nothing is sent automatically.
- Add a separate Suggest with History action. It scans downloaded mail from the exact same sender in the same account, within permitted folders, and sends the selected message plus the newest matches up to the saved AI message limit. It shows matched/used counts; it cannot read mail that has not been downloaded. Sender access is required, unchecked fields are withheld, and changed sources or revoked permissions discard in-flight results.
- Compact subject, sender and date/time presentation; recipient/mailbox details and full AI summaries remain expandable. Tighten native View/Sort controls, sidebar/list widths and reader spacing while retaining right/bottom/focused layouts.
- Add Test Connection directly in Search for the saved embedding model, plus Edit in Model. Model still tests unsaved fields. Both probes send only a fixed sentence and leave settings/index unchanged; results/errors appear near the top.
- Preserve the Rust desktop service, account-bound drafts, HTML isolation, reviewed provider operations, encrypted settings, backup and signed updater contracts.

CLI quick start:
- macOS: '/Applications/Morrow Mail.app/Contents/Resources/morrow-service' cli --help
- Windows PowerShell, from the extracted app folder: & '.\\resources\\app\\runtime\\morrow-service.exe' cli --help
- Usage, JSON contracts, review/send examples and limits: https://github.com/Coke1120/Morrow-Mail/blob/v${version}/docs/CLI.md
- Configure accounts in the app first. External agents with workspace access are not restricted by the in-app AI context checkboxes; trust the agent and authorize each delivery. No CLI attachments, account setup, implicit sync or automatic retries.

Updating:
- **One-time manual update from beta.4 and earlier:** the GitHub repository was renamed to Coke1120/Morrow-Mail. Older update checks reject its API redirect; download and install this package manually. This release uses the canonical address for future in-app updates, with signature and redirect protections unchanged.
- Keep a verified workspace backup and close the old app before opening the new one. The workspace stays separate from the app; binary rollback never silently restores an older database over current data.
- The signed manifest, pinned Ed25519 key, exact platform/version checks and SHA-256 validation remain unchanged. Read-only installation directories retain the manual-download option.

OAuth setup:
- Built-in Google Desktop OAuth remains available for Gmail and Google Calendar. Google Cloud API enablement, test-user access and provider verification remain publisher responsibilities; bundling the registration does not remove Testing restrictions.
- Outlook mail and Calendar use the bundled public Microsoft desktop registration by default; no user-supplied client ID, JSON or secret is required. Custom registrations remain available under Advanced. Organization policies may require administrator approval. Live Microsoft consent and Entra registration acceptance remain unverified; fixture checks do not establish provider approval.
- Bundled desktop app identifiers are extractable and are not user credentials. No mailbox tokens or private update signing key are shipped.

Packages:
- **macOS (Apple silicon, macOS 13.5+):** extract and move Morrow Mail.app to Applications. Fully native SwiftUI; ad-hoc signed and **not Apple notarized**.
- **Windows (x64, Windows 10/11):** extract the entire folder and run Morrow Mail.exe. Isolated Electron renderer; **unsigned prerelease**, which may show a SmartScreen warning.
- Both include their runtime. No Node or Rust installation is needed. Compare the supplied SHA-256 checksum before opening.

Beta limitations:
Live-account/provider acceptance, minimum-OS and other-hardware acceptance, complete manual UI/IME/accessibility testing and stable distribution signing remain pending. Sender-history context is bounded by the saved 1–50 message limit; each historical body is truncated to 5,000 UTF-16 characters and the selected body to 18,000. It is not an exhaustive model analysis of the whole mailbox. Native API, WebKit isolation and window lifecycle checks passed locally; browser fixture walkthroughs are not full native visual or live-account acceptance. The browser automation connection failed during an external-link confirmation check; protocol/sandbox tests passed, but that interactive step is not claimed. Provider/model tests used isolated fixtures without real sends, invitations or paid inference. Full provider delta/deletion sync, attachments, phishing/malware verdicts, sender blocking, app-wide AI spending caps and delayed/undo sending are not included. Studio simulations remain clearly labeled. Windows Tauri is not part of this release. This beta does not establish stable production readiness; see the tagged README.md, FEATURE_COVERAGE.md and VERIFICATION.md.
